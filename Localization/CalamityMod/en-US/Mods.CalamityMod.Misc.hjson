SwineSecret0: Hey
SwineSecret1: You know, swine like us tend to keep our secrets.
SwineSecret2: I once drank a gallon of molten pig iron.
SwineSecret3: Pay me 10 Ozzacoins and I'll hack in some Miracle Matter for ya, c'mon trust me!
SwineSecret4: I've heard tales of a palace somewhere...
SwineSecret5: Swine.
SwineSecret6: There once was a duke who was old, he sat on a throne made of gold, he ate up a treat, gave his kids spoiled meat, and sang tales of great swine never told.
SwineSecret7: WAIT WAIT A GOLDEN CRITTER JUST SPAWNE- aww you missed it...
SwineSecret8: Fishrons? Who calls them that?
SwineSecret9: Why the hell is everything always blowing up?! You're gonna start a fire you know, and I'm not a fan of flames!
SwineSecret10: HELP ME
SwineSecret11: Saying that someone 'eats babies' is stereotypically evil, but I'm a good guy and I eat babies! I mean surely it's not THAT bad. People who don't eat babies are just wusses.
SwineSecret12: Phalostion ale bonei wha treaites gon bardo galan ale gorve frus frum galibon!
SwineSecret13: My soul is made of jade, it's unbreakable! Just like the palace. You should go there sometime.
SwineSecret14: CAAAAAAARRRRLLLL! You must finish your work Carl.
SwineSecret15: Before gods quarreled or stars wept, it was the Old Duke's hunger that tore the first wound in the deep.
SwineSecret16: When the Third Moon drowned, the Old Duke wept salt into the jade chalice, and the coral gates first bled.
SwineSecret17: The Old Duke's hunger was not for flesh, but for the silence between tides that he called the Eel Hour.
SwineSecret18: The jade palace does not sink, it re-aligns beneath the fins of royal shame.
SwineSecret19: The duke never died. He just changed tides.
SwineSecret20: The Old Duke struck the reefclock thrice, and time drowned in brine-glass. Since then, no hour has been true.
SwineSecret21: There were once seven Duke-Born. then there were six, then there were five, then there were four, then there were three, then there were two, then there was one...
SwineSecret22: No one built the jade palace, the world simply uncoiled its seventh spine.
SwineSecret23: When the true fishron arises, the glorious jade palace shall rise once more from the sea and the ocean will kneel.
SwineSecret24: What mortals call the Old Duke is a mere echo of the pristine swine, the sovereign who ruled the sulphuric seas.
SwineSecret25: Gods speak in radiance. But the Old Duke? He chewed on their syllables and spat out storms.
SwineSecret26: Those who enter the Old Duke's stomach will learn what it means to be truly erased from samsara.
SwineSecret27: The great jade swine once whispered into Polterghast's ear, and that is why the moon forgot its face.
SwineSecret28: They say the Old Duke had no lungs. That's wrong, he had five.
SwineSecret29: The palace still sinks. It has not stopped sinking since the first sin.
SwineSecret30: The village people saw the fishron trade his draconic roar for silence. It was louder this way.
SwineSecret31: @everyone Please do not announce to the sever when you are going to fight Old Duke. This has been a recurring issue...
SwineSecret32: No, I have never played Undertale.
SwineSecret33: These sprites look like they were drawn by a four-year-old with the talents of Pablo Picasso in his prime. Which is what I would have said if I liked the sprites.      Which I do.      Not.
SwineSecret34: Who are you dressed as... your OC? That's cringe.
SwineSecret35: Watch out for Polymorphine, that stuff sucks. Trust me I know.
SwineSecret36: Many say to keep the greatest swine secret on the down low. I disagree, We cannot shh it.
SwineSecret37: Let me know when it's 7 PM, I've got to tweak something before some poor soul falls off of it!
SwineSecret38: Thank Xeroc I don't have any of that 'Pathfinding' garbage, whatever the hell that is.
SwineSecret39: If you think the Sulphur Sea smells bad, you're not close enough to me!
SwineSecret40: Did you know there's 40 of these damn things?
