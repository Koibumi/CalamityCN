ArmsDealerChat: {
	MentionQuadBarrel: That old man left a cranky old gun on his deathbed. You catching my drift?
	HasQuadBarrel: Hah! Look at that rusty old shotty. It looks straight out of the 70's!
	DoGDefeated: Is it me or are your weapons getting bigger and bigger?
	Eclipse: I thought moths went for light, what is one doing here?! You gonna need more than a boomstick if you want to kill that!
}

ClothierChat: {
	PolterghastDefeated: The voices have ceased... I don't want to know what you did there, but thank you.
	MoonLordDefeated1: Who you gonna call?
	MoonLordDefeated2: Those screams... I'm not sure why, but I feel like a nameless fear has awoken in my heart.
	MoonLordDefeated3: The voices I always kept hearing while in the Dungeon are back... There must be something behind them, I know when it's just my head.
	MoonLordPresent: Houston, we've had a problem.
}

CyborgChat: {
	MoonLordDefeated1: Always shoot for the moon! It has clearly worked before.
	MoonLordDefeated2: Draedon? The guy who made these upgrades on me said he wanted to best him. But I never cared about that, I just wanted to shoot lasers from my eyes.
	MentionPlague: Those big green roaches in the Jungle don't threaten me, but all of the animals it has consumed... Please, do me a favor and protect them.

DryadChat: {
	DarksunEclipse: There's a dark solar energy emanating from the moths that appear during this time. What's up with moths getting stronger as you do too?
	Hardmode: That starborne illness sits upon this land like a blister. Do even more vile forces of corruption exist in worlds beyond?
	DrunkPrincessShroom: "{0} put me up to this."
	Mushroom: I'm not here for any reason! Just picking up mushrooms for uh, later use.

	MoonLordDefeated: You know... we haven't had an invasion in a while...
}

GuideChat: {
	ProvidenceDefeated1: Killing a Goddess would obviously make her essence seep into the land, you can probably use the remnants of her power to make even more powerful gear!
	ProvidenceDefeated2: I've heard the Dragon Cult has something locked in the Dungeon they use to power their hexes, apparently messing with it can lead you to another world...
	MoonLordDefeated: I've seen members of the Dragon Cult outside of the Dungeon far more often than before... I think you should check what could be causing their displacement.
	Hardmode1: Could you be so kind as to, ah... check hell for me...? I left someone I kind of care about down there.
	Hardmode2: That earthquake wasn't natural, something must have caused it... Beware when exploring, whatever caused it must be a powerful entity, perhaps even otherworldly.

	Crags: Roses, really? That's such an overrated thing to paint.
	SulphurSea: Fun fact! Sulphur was used as pigment once upon a time! Or was it Cinnabar?
	Abyss: Easiest landscape I've ever painted in my life.
}

PartyGirlChat: {
	DrunkPrincess: I have a feeling we're going to have absolutely fantastic parties with {0} around!

	MoonLordDefeated: Yep! I'm also considering being a space pirate now.
	Astral: Some of my machines are starting to go haywire thanks to this Astral Infection. I probably shouldn't have built them here.
