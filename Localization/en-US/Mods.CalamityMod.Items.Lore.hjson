		'''
		While there are many sightless crevasses in the deep sea, this one is a geological marvel.
		It is located unsettlingly close to the shoreline. Somehow, even eons of tectonics could not seal or crush it.
		The isolated Abyss is the debatably tranquil home of the naiad Anahita and other reclusive sea creatures.
		Here I disposed of the burgeoning remains of Silva, the Goddess of Life itself. Obviously, she of all Gods refused to truly die.
		My wishes were that she would be forgotten, but her tenacity and very willpower is remarkable. 
		Diffused, her influence inundated that pit of crushing pressure with flora and fauna aplenty.
		Her great roots continue to thrash and tear at the impossibly dense stone, growing uncontrollably.
		She will soon remake it in her image. I can think of no worse fate for this accursed, hadal domain.

		Another once grand sea serpent, well-adapted to its harsh environs.
		Unlike the other Scourge, which was half starved and chasing scraps for its next meal; it lived comfortably.
		Microorganisms evolve rapidly, so it was able to maintain its filter feeding habits as the sea putrefied.
		What a stark contrast to the rest of the ecosystem. Nearly every other creature in the Sulphur Sea is hostile.
		A shame that its last bastion of tranquility has fallen.

		His wisdom guided my original conquests, making much of them possible at all. 
		As my crusade evolved and my ambitions grew, he expressed vehement disapproval.

		This twisted dreamscape is a starborne equivalent of the mundane rot you see in your lands.

		Left unchecked, their corpses bloat and fester.
		Typically, some semblance of order is maintained. It is not unlike the circle of life.
		Cosmic beings patrol the fathomless void and pick at the carrion, leaving nothing but clean bones.
		The infection itself is a disturbance from deep space. It has a mind of its own, projecting its will upon life and land.
		Those whose minds can grasp the true form of the universe are largely immune.

		The infection that tainted its body is from beyond Terraria. Neither I nor Draedon recognize it fully.
		With its will subsumed, it hurled a chunk of infested astral matter at our world, then came to guard it.

		It was never clear why her slumber ended. At first it was a stir. The people were cautiously optimistic.
		Her awakening was horrific. Inferno billowed through the streets. None were safe from the flames.
		Fate had a sick sense of humor that day, for Calamitas to be there to match her.

		None have borne the brunt of misfortune quite like the Brimstone Witch, Calamitas.
		When I first saw her, she was still a girl. Prostrated in my court, garbed in charred rags as she trembled.
		I could not grasp the unfathomable, raw power of the fell magics that coursed through her.
		She could scant control it herself. Permafrost recognized this immediately. With a pained face, he counseled me to look after her.
		The Witch entered his tutelage, and soon after my service. She was ablaze with desire to douse the Gods in her wicked wrath.
		Indeed, the faithful already quaked in her presence. Her name was a moniker of theirs, one uttered quietly in fear.
		In my campaigns, I counted on her sheer capacity for annihilation as my ace in the hole.
		No man: army, city or God could stand against her unbridled fury.
		Eventually, the girl's horrific sin was too much for her to bear. She left my side along with her mentor.
		The weight of her deeds haunts her to this day. She despises me, and I cannot blame her.
		Please, if you would... show her respect where I did not.

		A contained, previously inert portal sealed in the Dungeon. The presiding cult kept it a closely guarded secret.
		Upon sighting the Devourer of Gods, their leader hurriedly led me to its chamber to reveal its existence to me.
		The portal led to the Devourer's home. It was identical to his, only ancient and perfectly stable.
		The serpent claimed: It too was his creation. Its permanence was a mistake he later rectified.
		But this rift was unquestionably far older than he. It had dated back to the Golden Age of Dragons.
		His lie was thin and forced. Something far more powerful than the Devourer was at hand.
		Its eerie persistence gnawed at my mind. It did not just threaten me. It threatened everyone. Everything.

		I ordered Draedon to armor his gargantuan form, so he could safely best even the greater Gods in single combat.
		Fittingly, he possessed a serpent's tongue. He manipulated me incessantly, driving me to awful acts.
		I recruited him out of desperation. My war had dragged on for decades, and I would do anything to have it end.
		It was then my negligence was born. My descent began the moment recruiting this scoundrel crossed my mind.

LoreStormWeaver: {
	DisplayName: Storm Weaver
	Lore:
		'''
		This beast while of lesser stature than the Devourer, is a great danger in its own right.
		They are clearly of the same species. Even this serpent was known to devour Wyverns whole.
		Very little is known about the realm or space that the Great Devourer hails from.
		Even Draedon and his obsessive research has been unable to discern its true nature.
		The Weaver slipped through a rift from this place opened by the Devourer, and he has monitored it since.
		In his mind, the lesser serpent's similar powers could lead it to be too threatening for him to let live.
		Little does he know, he has forever stood in a similar position. He thinks himself invincible after all.

LoreSulphurSea: {
	DisplayName: Sulphur Sea
	Lore:
		'''
		This seaside has never been pleasant, though it has seen far better days.
		Incessant fumes rising from the industry of Azafure inundate the water with caustic ions.
		Despite this, the hardy life adapted to the new environment. No doubt aided by Silva as she burrowed through to the underworld.
		Long considered uninhabitable, its further deterioration led Draedon to designate it as a dumping ground.
		Years of careless waste disposal has now left the coast's transformation irreversible.

LoreTwins: {
	DisplayName: The Twins
	Lore:
		'''
		Not all of warfare is direct combat. Logistics, intelligence and wit are paramount in equal ways to ensure victory.
		These machines are my finest scouts and agents, reborn in a form that gives them sight unrivaled.
		An enemy is only as safe as you let him be: Archers, spies, assassins and more allow you to keep a decisive edge. 
		Draedon understood well that the only fair fight is the one you win.
		His assistance was infallible, his calculus cold and cruel.
		Not even the most evasive target stood a chance.

LoreUnderworld: {
	DisplayName: The Underworld
	Lore:
		'''
		The hellish reputation the underworld gets is rather a recent development. 
		The layers of ash choking the formerly great cities is still warm. 
		The more domineering of Gods wished for me to champion their causes, asking to rule their society from here. 
		Yet despite being surrounded by magma, Azafure simply burned when their wishes were not met.
		Such is the unfortunate price of war, though I have no regrets fighting for my people.

LoreWallofFlesh: {
	DisplayName: The Wall of Flesh
	Lore:
		'''
		To contain the essence of a slain God is no small thing. It is rather a towering, ghastly construct.
		The Wall was lashed together with foul sinew and fouler magics, forming a rudimentary prison of flesh.
		It served its purpose: halting the diffusion of undue divine influence.
		Were it not for this alchemical breakthrough, the very world I fought for may have been lost in the carnage I wrought.
		My methods have since evolved. I need not contain such essences, when they can be devoured.
		May you channel my valor in combating the resulting outpour of energies.

LoreYharon: {
	DisplayName: Yharon, Resplendent Phoenix
	Lore:
		'''
		The return of the Age of Dragons, dashed. Just like that, it is but ashes in the wind….
		Yharon was the last of the Auric Dragons. As a phoenix, his domain of power includes rebirth.
		The Gods thought him culled with the rest of his kind, but he returned as an egg. Hidden on the Aerie.
		I was destined to consume his Auric soul when he hatched, and rule forever as God-King.

		[c/FCA92B:Destiny is for the weak.]

		I rejected their whims, and upended their scheme. I was sentenced to execution for treason.
		Their meek, ingratiated swine cast both Yharon's egg and I into the magma of Hell.
		The intense heat hideously scarred me, but birthed Yharon anew. He rose, wreathed in fire and saved my life.
		From that day, our souls were one. He shared with me the tale of Zeratros, and the genocide of his kind.
		I promised him I would have justice. So the war began, Yharon rallying all as a beacon of hope.
		Now, that hope is long withered. I am but a husk of the hero I once was, and this is the ultimate proof.
		Yharon may yet return, as he does, but he… he has bade me farewell.
